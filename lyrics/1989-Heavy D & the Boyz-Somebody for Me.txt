oh yeah.. love somebo-dy... love somebo-dy who loves me for me happy hap-py where i wanna be i'll search low, and i'll search high tryin to find myself a cutie pie but destiny leads me to a dead end (love somebo-dy) over and over and over again they told me to wait, so i waited anticipated, debatin and delayed it but still came up with the same ol' thing ..nothing! (nothing, nothing...) it seems as if every time i find a right girl she turns out to be a big wrong girl tell me y'all, when will this madness stop? (stop, stop, stop, stop...) i want somebody to love me for me not because i'm mc, heavy d i'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock (rock, rock, rock, rock...) now maybe i'll take a trip around the world and find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl they say when you look, one never find they also say that love is blind it ain't that blind that i can't see somebody out there who's perfect for me somebody who's gonna love me, for me... (i know you want love...) love, that's what i'm talkin about a relationship, a commitment something to live for... (maybe if you take, your time...) time has been taken and time has been spent now it's time for the lover to score... yo, eddie f. break it down! yeah...aight, here we go so that's the storyline of my life no cutie pie, no future wife just relationships that bounce back like rubber... i guess i'll call it a day and throw my towel in cause it seems that i can't win so i'll just carry on being an overweight lover
