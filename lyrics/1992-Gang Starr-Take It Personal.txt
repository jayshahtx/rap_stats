take it personal i never thought that you would grab me undermine me, and backstab me but i can see clearly now the rain is gone the pain is gone but what you did was still wrong there was a few times i needed your support but you tried to play me like an indoor sport like racquetball, tennis, pool, whatever all i know is that you attempted to be clever nevertheless, cleverness can't impress cause now you've been exposed like a person undressed cause i see through you, because i'm the guru now what you gonna do when i step to you and when i pay you back i'll be hurting you and this ain't no threat so take it personal take it personal rap is an art you can't own no loops it's how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop so don't even think you could say someone bit off your weak beat come on you need to quit i flip lines and kick rhymes that never sound like yours there oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws originality overflows in the end the truth is, that you wish you could live the life i live and kick the lyrics i kick but bear in mind that you can't think as quick so premier drops a beat, for me to say verses to and if i sound doper then take it personal don't be mad cause i don't come around the way like i used to, i don't have time these days i'm keeping busy making power moves don't try to say i don't remember you you shouldn't let your jealousy show like that i stopped coming by, cause of the way you act telling my business to kids i don't even know you're like a daytime talk show, and that's low so you can tell everyone, that i'm jerking you and if you don't like it kid, take it personal
