*phone rings* what the fuck do you want? (promise that you will sing about me) god, just leave me the fuck alone (just promise that you will sing about me) values in a disarray, prioritizing horribly tryna give you less bullshit and more of me historically, see i've been known to give up when it's boring me holds no type of value or begins to feel like chores to me it's more to me than what meets the eye road to insanity with panic in my blind side passing me by, pharcyde i'm a far cry from content and i just hope you listen the reason that i call myself a misfits, it's a given spitting image of this rap shit, tryna tour across the atlas but i can't even come to grips with who i am, no catfish passionate words with mad kicks, hot sixteens and ad-libs is not enough to encapsulate what i think on the average i'm mad sick, no, i'm actually mad sick like everything i have left goes into this rap shit it's tragic text messages from people i don't even like, daily all concerned about what i've been going through lately cause when the light shuts off and it's my turn to settle down my main concern is promise that you will sing about me just promise that you will sing about me (2x) can't tell if you really care or if you're just being noisy ring around the rosie got a pocket full of hope, please if i fall down, see, can i count on you to hold me down, when i'm not there will you shoot me down lowkey? like bo beep, i'ma a black sheep rummaging through my rap sheet tryna make sense of all the mistakes i made last week on the brink of destruction can you help me out, i'm asking "never show signs of weakness, pretend strength everlasting" is what i'm taught so i now i barely even fall and if i do, build up a wall like nothing happened at all kneeling, i'm on the floor, i'm calling out to god but we ain't spoke in a while so i'm ashamed to ask for more and pride'll be my downfall but pride is what made me so now i'm so conflicting and contradicting, it's crazy i can spill out my soul and you'll barely comprehend, maybe but you'd never understand what i've been going through lately i try to like, put everything i'm thinking into one verse and maybe get you to understand what i'm thinking or how i feel but i mean, who am i kidding? you'll probably never understand anyway... *answering machine*
